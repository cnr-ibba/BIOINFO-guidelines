About Singularity
-----------------

**Singularity** is a free, cross-platform and open-source computer program for virtualization.
Singularity is used to create reproducibile and portable software containers for scientific computing and high-performance computing (HPC).
Reproducibility and portability imply the possibility to move containers from system to system (e.g. a new machine).
With Singularity containers developers can work in customized reproducible environments that can be copied and executed on other platforms.
You can refer to the `singularity`_ official documentation.

Containers
~~~~~~~~~~

Containers are single files and allow to transfer computing environments withouth worrying about installing all needed sotware and dependencies on each different OS or machine.
Containers are very useful for **reproducible science**: Singularity containers would include all programs, libraries, data and scripts for a specific scientific problem, and can then be archived or distributed for replication no matter what hardware architecture or OS is used.
