Welcome to BIOINFO Guidelines's documentation!
==============================================

In these pages we want to track our general documentation and guidelines at *IBBA-CNR*.
The aim of this repository is to describe some useful procedures to newcomers
and save useful informations for ourself. We try to generalize
how much as possible in writing this documentation, so maybe this documentation
works also for you.

If you want to contribute, please see the :ref:`Contributing <contributing>`
section of our documentation.
