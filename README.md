[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/bioinfo-guidelines/badge/?version=latest)](https://bioinfo-guidelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

## Welcome to BIOINFO-guidelines Documentation project

Welcome to the git repository where we track our general documentation and
guidelines at *IBBA-CNR*. The aim of this repository is to describe some useful
procedures to newcomers and save useful information for ourself. We try to generalize
how much as possible in writing this documentation, so maybe this documentation
works also for you.

The documentation is available at [readthedocs](https://bioinfo-guidelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
and is automatically compiled and updated everytime this repository is updated. If
you want to contribute, please see [Contributing](https://bioinfo-guidelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html#contributing)
section of our documentation
